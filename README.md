# Rock - Paper - Scissors

## Description
This was the java code from a fun competition our team did at Gilbert Public School District to hone our Java skills.  Each team member added their own code/logic based on their algorithm of how they wanted to select their next 'play' (rock/paper/scissors) to their Java file <player-name>.java
